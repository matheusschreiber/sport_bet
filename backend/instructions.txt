disclaimer:
  in this backend i was using nodemon when building the code in the beggining, but then i was getting 
  some erros about connection refused because the server was restarting each time the json file was
  updated, so that was causing me a lot of trouble. I change the start script to only node index when i
  was testing the frontend stuff.

  You can change back to 'nodemon src/index.js' whenever you desire.
